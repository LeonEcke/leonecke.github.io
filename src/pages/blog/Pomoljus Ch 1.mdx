Chapter one in the project log for the Pomoljus project. This log will dive into the solidification of the Pomoljus into the physical realm and talk about the first out of hopefully many failures and what I learnt from it.

## The Physical Realm

As the Pomoljus is a physical object, it's also constrained by physical laws. For electricity to flow from the battery to the LEDs, there needs to be some sort of connection between them made from some conductive material.
The standard for this nowdays happens to be copper <sup>*(or gold if you're fancy)*</sup> stuck to a glassfiber sheet. This is of course a printed circuit board, or PCB. But you cant just connect a power source to a light, as the amount of power that flows through the circuit is directly proportional to the resistance in said circuit.
Upsettingly for us in this purpose, the copper traces on the PCB, and most of our components are quite low resistance, which would give us a current so high that the components would go poof.
Thankfully for us in this purpose, the solution is simple. Just add resistance. For that matter, we have a similar issue with unwanted noise in our various copper traces. So we just filter those out. But to do that, we suddenly need more components.
Our simple corcuit now turned a touch more complex. PCBs are also usually quite ridgid unless you pay extra.
So to make sure we fit the design from the previous chapter [citation], we will actually need two PCBs. One for the lights and two buttons, then one for the rest of it. At least that's the current idea.

## The Lightbar

Five SK6812 RGB LEDs and two buttons of some kind that need to pivot on a central axis. Those are the only two requirements of this board. But if it was this simple.
First things first, we need to connect this PCB with the other PCB. This can be solved in many ways, like having some naked copper pads to solder a couple wires to, or perhaps you add some edge connectors and solder the PCBs together directly.
Both these are valid, but come with their own challenges and limitations. I instead chose a different set of challenges and decided to use a standardized connector.

But which connector? Well, how many wires do we need? We need two wires for each buttons input data, then another for sending data to the SK6812s. Then we also need to power the components, which means we want a 5V and GND wire too. So 5 wires in total. Some searching lead to a JST connector[citation]. If you've seen one of the later Raspberry Pi Pico dev boards, then you will recognice it as the beige connector at the opposite end from the USB port.

Okay, but hold on. Since the 639 page long datasheet for the RP2040 has been a steady companion on all of our nightstands for the past few weeks, we obviously know that the RP2040 can only put out 3.3V. But the SK6812s require a 5V data input? What does that even mean?

### Tangent: Logic levels and voltages

Data in the electrical world is represented in many ways. But in the core of it all are the bits. The smallest possible pieces of information. Ones and zeroes. Bits themselves have no intrinsic meaning, and is completely up to the reader.
The buttons for example will "give" a one when pressed in, and a zero when not. But the SK6912s bits will be more structured, taking the shape of 16 bit long binary values in a certain order.

But what are bits? Well that depends on where you want the bits to be. If you're a mainframe computer in the 60s, the bits are probably holes in a sheet of paper. But we're a Pomoljus. For us, the bits are electricity! 
More specifically, they're differences in voltages.

But what are voltages? Okay, lets maybe not go that far. But what voltages is a valid question. You can't stuff 220V into a computer and call it a bit. Things and stuff expect certain voltages, both to work and to decypher them into bits. 
And just to be funny, the voltage to power a device and the voltage it wants as digital logic are usually different. How fun!
The SK6812 LEDs for example require 5V both to power them, and for their data inputs. But the RP2040 that will run the show is powered by 5V, but it's data inputs and outputs are required to be in 3.3V. Which sadly for us is lower than 5V.

Well what if we try and stick it to *the man* and push 3.3V into the 5V logic input of the SK6812 then what? Other than being a real rebel... Nothing really. 3.3 is roughly halfway between logical levels for the SK6812 of zero and five.
That means that the rebellious attempts at bits go straight into **undefined limbo**. 0V will probably still be a zero, but who knows what 3.3V will mean. All in all it's pretty harmless.

That can't be said for if you send 5V into something expecting 3.3V. At the best, you get some undefined behaviour; at worst, you get a puff of magic smoke. Since the device isn't expecting anything above 3.3V, making it able to handle it would just be a waste of resources.

Now that should be enough redundant text about things that most people already know either explicitly or intuativly to return us to where we left off.

### Tangent end

Where were we? Right, two different logic levels. Thankfully for us, there's ways to solve this quite easily with the use of a transistor. Think of a transistor as an electrically controlled switch. It takes a current or voltage to controll the internal resistance between two points. That allows a lower voltage source to control a highter voltage source.
Exactly what we need to step up the data from 3.3V to 5V. So let's add a transistor to the shopping list. But... Which transistor? PNP, or NPN, or MOSFET, or J-FET, or... Don't worry about it. This isn't a new problem that needs solving, and smarter people have solved it before. Oh, and we also need another resistor.

Okay and now the buttons. How will they work? Do you press one and they connect 5V to the button input? No, that would just require the other end to have a resistor.
And even then, the RP2040 isn't rated for 5V inputs. So we need to step it down. That we do through the use of a basic electrical principle called voltage division. So we need two more resistors per button to utilize this.

Now for the power supply. Basically all wires act like antennas, which means they pick up whatever signals they can. This is usually just noise and not something we want. So we have to filter it out. This too is an easy fix, though the decoupuling capacitors we are about to add. Capacitors work like tiny batteries <sup>*(Unless you ask my uni teacher, in which case they're closer to rubber bands)*</sup>. The main point is that they resist changes in voltages. How quickly is dependant on their size. Now if we see the noise we have as changes from the standard 5V, then we can also see how adding a component that resists those changes could help us! That's at least the basic idea behind the decoupling transistors that we will add. One for each LED and one for the connector. 

Bam, the shopping list is basically done. To handle the 3 components we wanted, we ended up needing an additional [Sätt in mängd!]! This is ofcourse not the only way to do something, and I'm sure I've made a bakers dozen mistakes. But that's part of the process! Now all we need to do is source every single component. This is not *hard* but it is time consuming, and at times a bit frustrating. The companies that target hobbyists seems to like their 20%-70% conveinence markups. But with some time and effort you can do it. [Links to prefered sites?]Links to prefered sites? The important part here is knowing what fottprint your components will have. The sizes of your passives <sup>*(Resistors, Capacirots, and more)*</sup> are pretty solidly standardized. The transistor is also quite standard. The SK6812s are on the other hand a bit of a bigger question and might require custom made footprints in your PCB CAD software. Since I decided to surface mount my hole mounted buttons, I'll need to do this step anyway. 

Now we can work on the layout and design!
